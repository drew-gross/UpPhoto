    <p>UpPhoto is a fast and easy photo uploader for facebook. With UpPhoto, the time it takes to upload photos to Facebook drops from minutes to seconds. Just Put your photos in a special UpPhoto folder that is created when you install UpPhoto, and they will automatically appear on Facebook.</p>
    <p>UpPhoto began as an app developed over the course of 24 hours during the University of Waterloo/University of Toronto Facebook Hackathon. After realizing that UpPhoto was a useful app, we decided to polish and release it.</p>
