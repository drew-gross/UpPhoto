                    UpPhoto is a fast and easy photo uploader for facebook. With UpPhoto, the time it
                    takes to upload photos to Facebook drops from minutes to seconds. Just Put your
                    photos in a special UpPhoto folder that is created when you install UpPhoto, and
                    they will automatically appear on Facebook. You can even tell UpPhoto to upload
                    all the photos from your digital camera whenever you plug it in, or from your webcam
                    whenever you take a photo, and you don't need to do a thing.
